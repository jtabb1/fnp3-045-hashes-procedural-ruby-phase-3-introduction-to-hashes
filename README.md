## Introduction

Up until this point, we've stored our data in a list form using arrays. An
array is like a numbered list. It stores a group of items which are accessible
via their location, or index number, in the list. A `Hash`, in comparison, is a
"lookup table" like a dictionary.

Imagine a grocery list: you need to go to the store and buy milk, eggs and
bread. You could store your list like this:

```ruby
groceries = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
```

But now let's say we wanted to "look up" the prices of these items. We could
write:

```ruby
prices = [3.00, 2.15, 2.35] # milk, eggs, bread prices
```

But wait, why not write this as:

```ruby
prices = [2.35, 3.00, 2.15]  # bread, milk, eggs prices
```

Well, that's perfectly _legal_ as well to Ruby. But what we want is a way to
associate the word `"milk"` to the price `3.00`. A code comment isn't a strong
enough bond between the `String` (grocery item) and the `Float` (price). When
you need to associate a value with a lookup "_key_", you want a `Hash`.

Hashes allow us to store named, or associated, data. Think of a dictionary or
an address book. This allows us to store more complex collections of
information than the arrays we've seen so far. With a hash, we can associate
item names to prices.

## Define a Ruby Hash

A _hash_ is a collection of data that is separated into pairs of keys and
values. Each key/value pair makes up one unit in the hash. The entire collection
of key/value pairs, which are comma separated, is enclosed in curly braces `{}`:

```ruby
{"key" => "value", "another_key" => "another value"}
```

In this example, the `String` `"key"` is the key to the value `"value"`. The
key `"another_key"` is used to "point to" the `String` value, `"another_value"`.

As with Arrays, you can use white space to make it more friendly for humans to
read:

```ruby
{
  "key" => "value",
  "another_key" => "another value"
}
```

Remember just a moment ago we were asking how to associate a grocery item to a
price? Here's how a `Hash` allows us to do that:

```ruby
prices = {
"bread" => 2.35,
"milk" =>  3.00,
"eggs" =>  2.15
}
```

The relationship between a _key_ (or lookup name) and its associated value is
indicated by using the `=>` symbol (sometimes lovingly referred to as a
"hash-rocket").

## Define Hash Keys

_Keys_ are the things we "look up" with. In our grocery prices example, the
keys are the `String`s `"bread"`, `"milk"`, and `"eggs"`.

`Hash` keys can be any type of data but most of the time we use
[Strings][strings] (as seen in the grocery/prices example) or
[Symbols][symbols] like the following:

```ruby
{:name => "John Henry", :occupation => "Steel-driving man"}
```

Somewhat confusingly, Ruby has **another** syntax for writing `Hash`es that
have a `Symbol` as key. We call `Hash`es defined this way "JSON (pronounced
'Jay-Sawn') `Hash`es."

```ruby
{name: "John Henry", occupation: "Steel-driving Man"}
```

You'll definitely see both when you do research online, so you need to
recognize both.  Ruby gained "JSON Hashes" in order to increase its ability to
share data with JavaScript (the JS in JSON stands for JavaScript). It's a great
idea, but (sorry!) it's a little confusing when you're starting out.

Most of the time, for keys, Rubyists prefer [Symbols][symbols] (there are
performance reasons that we'll cover elsewhere).

For comparison, here's the same hash written using `String`s as the key:

```ruby
{"name" => "John Henry", "occupation" => "Steel-driving man"}
```

## Define Hash Values

Hash values are the bits of data that are returned when we give a `Hash` a
_key_ to use to do a look up. The values in the grocery / prices example are:
`2.35`, `3.00`, and `2.15`.

_Keys_ are the things we look up by, in our grocery example these are the
`String`s `"bread"`, `"milk"`, and `"eggs"`.

Hash values don't need to contain values of all the same type. You can have
`String`s, other scalar data, or even other `Array`s or `Hash`es!

```ruby
{:item => "banana", :price => 0.89, :quantity => 6, :description => "a delicious fruit"}
```

## Create a Hash using its implicit ("Hash-Literal") form

The easiest way to create a `Hash` is to write it out as we've seen in the
examples so far.

```ruby
new_hash = {
  :created => Time.now,
  :message => "Hello world!"
}
#=> {:created=>2019-04-10 14:05:33 -0400, :message=>"Hello world!"}
```

This is what is referred to as the _implicit_ or "`Hash` literal" form. When
assigning a variable, Ruby will interpret the curly braces on the left hand
side as a Hash.

Once created, we can access this `Hash` with our `new_hash` variable:

```ruby
new_hash = {
  :created => Time.now,
  :message => "Hello world!"
}
new_hash
#=> {:created=>2019-04-10 13:42:27 -0400, :message=>"Hello world!"}
```

> **MASTER YOUR LEARNING**: Try writing the sample we just showed you in the
> JSON Hash Style in IRB.

## Create a Hash with `Hash.new`

Alternatively, we can use `Hash.new` to create a new hash:

```ruby
second_new_hash = Hash.new
#=> {}
```

This is the same as writing:

```ruby
second_new_hash = {}
#=> {}
```

## Conclusion

We're just getting started with hashes, but hopefully, you can already see why
they might be useful. With hashes, we can use hash keys as a way of _naming_
individual pieces of data. Including multiple key/value pairs allows us to
_associate_ different bits of data, bundling them all up into one object.

Now that we can create hashes and store data as key/value pairs, in the next
lesson, we'll look at how we can access, update, and even delete those "pairs."
